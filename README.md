# IOS-Portfolio-2020

My name is Tyler George, I'm a junior at Eden Prairie Highschool. I've dabbled in coding in the past but never really stuck with it untill I took this IOS class and since then I have been enjoying it. I have learned an incredible amount in just a few months and the projects in this repository are what I've been working on.
